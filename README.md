# About Me

Hi my name is Liam! I'm nineteen years old, and currently enrolled in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. I'm hoping to become a developer so I can live wherever I need, and have the ability to move across country to live with the one I love. These are some of my current projects I've completed. I can't wait to see it expand as my knowledge increases!
